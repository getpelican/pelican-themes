# Agency 
## A One Page Portfolio Theme For Pelican
### Ported from [Agency](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
Additional configurable options in pelicanconf.py:  
SITETITLE (_also used in menu navigation_)  
SITESUBTITLE  
INTRO\_LG (_top line of landing page_)  
INTRO\_SM (_second line of landing page_)  
PORTFOLIO\_TITLE

The `contents` folder contains portfolio, team, about and 'client logos' images (*see sample content folder*).  
Each section (services, about, team, contact, clients' aside, etc) is a seperate include of the index template, making it easy to customize the order -- or removal -- of any section.
