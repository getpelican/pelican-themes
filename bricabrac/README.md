# Bricabrac
## A minimalist Pelican theme
Bricabrac is a minimalist theme for the static site generator [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).
It is based on the [mnmlist theme](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/mnmlist).

## How-to

To use this theme, just extract the archive and copy the bricabrac theme folder to the `themes` folder in your Pelican site path. Then add the line below to your pelicanconf.py :

    THEME = 'themes/bricabrac-pelican-theme'

## Localization

This theme can handle several locales and languages for your website through the i18n-subsites jinja extension.

## Live demo

You can see a live demo of this theme on my personal web-log : [bricabraque.grainedutopie.eu](https://bricabrac.grainedutopie.eu).
