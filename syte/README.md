Syte theme for Pelican
======================

This theme is based on [Syte][syte] and is for Pelican. Right now, its a bit messy. But I'll clean this up later.

Anyway, you can [see this theme in action here][samrat].

To try this out, clone this repo and in your `settings.py`, set `THEME = /path/to/syte-pelican` and `MEDIA_URL= /path/to/syte-pelican/static`.
