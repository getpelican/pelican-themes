# Bricks theme

This is a responsive theme made for [Pelican](http://www.getpelican.com),
a static site generator.

It is powered by [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) and uses Exo 2,
a font from Google Fonts.

It's still a work in progress -- I have yet to set up placeholders for Disqus
integration, for instance, and there's work to do when it comes to properly
integrate metadata info (because, you know, Google). But it is fully functional,
works on all major browsers (Firefox, Chrome, IE, and even unknown ones like
Vivaldi and Midori), and most importantly it works both on mobile and desktop
platforms.  :-)
