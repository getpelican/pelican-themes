### What is Gum?

Gum is a clean and responsive theme for [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican), based on the [Gumby Framework](http://gumbyframework.com/docs).

### Requirements

* [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican)

### Configuration

* Edit your settings file to include the following if desired (any values left blank won't show up in the theme):

```
GITHUB_URL = ''
TWITTER_URL = ''
FACEBOOK_URL = ''
GOOGLEPLUS_URL = ''
```

This theme uses the latest Google Analytics code, which will be included when the following values are filled out appropriately.

```
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID = ''
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SITENAME = ''
```

Alternatively you can use [Piwik](http://piwik.org/) for analytics if you set the following settings, where the url has to be given without leading `http://` and trailing `/`.

```
PIWIK_ID = ''
PIWIK_URL = ''
```

To use Juvia for comments, fill out the following values, again the url without leading `http://` and trailing `/`.

```
JUVIA_URL = ''
JUVIA_ID = ''
```
