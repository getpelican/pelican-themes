# bricks-theme

This is a responsive theme made for static blog engine [Pelican](http://www.getpelican.com). 

It is powered by [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) and Exo 2 font, by Google Fonts.

It's still a work in progress -- I have yet to setup placeholders for Disqus integration, for instance, and 
there's work to do when it comes to properly integrate metadata info (because, you know, Google)
but it is fully functional, works on all major browsers (Firefox, Chrome, IE), even unknown ones (Vivaldi,
Midori) and, most important, it works both on mobile and desktop platforms :-)
