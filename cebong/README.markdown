# pelican-cebong-theme #

This theme is focused on simplicity and solarized-looks, its structure was derived from the pelican's *notmyidea* theme, and I altered some stuff to look more like [my old tumblr blog](http://kecebongsoft.tumblr.com), which is pretty much solarized-like.

This theme is used for [my pelican blog](http://kecebongsoft.com). 

You can add a tagline below the title using `SITETAGLINE`, and add
additional footer information with `FOOTERTEXT`
